    title: <b>Biography</b>
    summary: |
      I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the
        <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE" target="_blank"><b>Lyles School of Civil and Construction Engineering</b></a>
        at Purdue University. I have conducted my doctoral research in
        <a href="https://umnilab.github.io/" target="_blank"><b>UMNILAB</b></a>
        under the guidance of Dr. Satish V. Ukkusuri.
        My work develops physics-informed and data-driven methods to model, estimate, and secure network traffic dynamics in
        connected and autonomous mobility, with a particular focus on transportation cybersecurity and behavior-aware resilience
        under route guidance attacks.
        <br><br>
        My research develops physics-informed and data-driven methods to model, estimate, and secure network traffic dynamics in
        connected and autonomous mobility. My dissertation, <i>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Secure Connected and Autonomous Traffic Modeling</i>,
        centers on network resilience and reliability, user behavior, and transportation cybersecurity.
        <br><br>
        
        My current research focuses on:
        <br>
        - <b>Physics-informed learning for network-scale traffic dynamics and state estimation</b>:
        scalable modeling and inference for large-scale urban networks using traffic-flow theory and physics-informed learning.
        <br>
        - <b>Network resilience under climate and cyber disruptions</b>:
        quantifying how climate-driven disruptions and cyber disruptions propagate through transportation networks, and developing
        reliability- and recovery-oriented modeling and decision support for resilient operations.
        <br>
        - <b>Behavior-aware transportation cybersecurity</b>:
        modeling and mitigating route guidance attacks and related adversarial behaviors by integrating behavioral models and game-theoretic insights.
        <br>
        - <b>Graph and network learning for large-scale mobility data</b>:
        improving data completeness and reliability for network monitoring and downstream control/management tasks.
        <br><br>
        
        Overall, my goal is to enable trustworthy, resilient, and scalable mobility decision support by integrating traffic theory,
        machine learning, and behavioral modeling to operate under uncertainty and compound disruptions.
