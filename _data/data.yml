    title: <b>Biography</b>
    summary: |
      I am a PhD student in the in <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE" target="_blank"> <b>Lyles School of Civil Engineering</b></a> and <a href="http://www.satishukkusuri.com/" target="_blank"> <b>UMNILAB (advisor: Dr. Satish V. Ukkusuri)</b></a> at Purdue University  since August 2020.
      Prior to joining Purdue, I was a researcher at Seoul National University from 2018-2020, where my research focused on developing multi-capacity vehicle routing problem of demand responsive transport for the disabled (presented in <a href="https://annualmeeting.mytrb.org/OnlineProgramArchive/Details/13846" target="_blank"> <b>99th TRB Annual Meeting</b></a>), and modeling lane change behaviors on freeways and gap acceptance behaviors at roundabouts in real driving situations and virtual reality (published in Journal of Advanced Transportation <a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/2726732" target="_blank"> <b>2018</b></a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/7525721" target="_blank"> <b>2020</b></a>). Previously, I completed BSc (2016) and MSc (2018) in Civil and environmental Engineering at Seoul National University.
      Now, My research focuses on as follows:
         <p><b> - Network Traffic Model</b>: Modeling traffic dynamics in large-scale urban areas from physics-informed machine learning and mathematical traffic flow model; Quantifying uncertainties of road traffic dynamics from generative models; Identifying relationships between network structures and traffic dynamics  <br><i>    Applications: Perimeter control, Traffic signal control, Traffic estimation, Transportation Network Design</i></p>
         <p><b> - Emerging Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems</b>: Estimating traffic states (e.g., traffic density, speed, and traffic flow) under connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) environment; Developing routing algorithms and platooning strategies for CAVs to minimize the impacts of uncertainties in vehicle dynamics (e.g., dynamic road environments and traffic congestion); Modeling traffic dynamics of on-demand urban air mobility from network traffic fundamental diagram <br><i>   Applications:  Autonomous Vehicle routing, Autonomous truck scheduling, Air traffic management, IoT Cybersecurity</i></p>
